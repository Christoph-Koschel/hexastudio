# Overview

HexaStudio should be the central hub for all of my projects. I spent a lot of time working and planning to find the best
method for publishing my work to the world. While GitHub is a great platform, I found it too impersonal for my needs. I
thought that a comprehensive website with a studio-like system would be the best solution, but it turned out to be a lot
of work. In the end, I decided to create a simple portfolio website.
